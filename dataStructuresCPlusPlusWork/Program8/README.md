Description copied from project: 

"Use a linked implementation of the Queue Abstract Data Type to simulate how a bank serves its customers. The bank maintains one Queue to line up customers who arrive at the bank. The bank has four teller service stations. If a teller has no customer, the teller will serve the next customer in the waiting Queue. Each teller will keep their own Queue of customers served. By seeing the Queue of customers served by each teller, we can analyze how efficiently services were given.

The program development will comprise two parts. In the first part, design, code, and individually test each class used by the program. In the second part, bring all the classes together to develop and test the overall bank queue simulator using the algorithm given below."
