Best Case: We only have to add one new item to an empty list.
Worse Case: We have to add items to the list equal to the max capacity of that list. Each item we add has a different key and the order we add it in is unsorted. So we will have to resort the list each time we add an element.

BigO of Contains
-Binary O(log base(n))

BigO of Insert
-Run sequential to see where in the list the new item(or rather the new key) will go
-O(n)
